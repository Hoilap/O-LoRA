Title: Excellent moral buried under a ton of discolored ham
Text: The long-running classic Broadway musical about romance in the Pacific theater of WWII took awhile to make it to film, and it just does not hold up over time. The dubbed-in operatic baritone by an Italian actor playing a Frenchman with an Italian accent both when he speaks and when he sings (?) sounds ludicrous to the 21st-century ear, the dialogue is frequently laughable, and the bizarre directorial decision to film some scenes through color filters that just look nasty, combine to make this an exceptionally overrated piece of nostalgic cheese. Plenty of ham to go with it, too. Bleah. The only reason there's more than one star in my rating is that the film does very well in making its point against racism, a socially redeeming factor that was very much germaine in the late '50s. But that's no reason anyone should be subjected to this snoozer at this late date.

Title: Magnificent Film, Poor Transfer
Text: This is a magnificent movie and a truly moving tale of a poor Samurai who yearns to live the life of a farmer, raise his two little girls and live in peace. An accomplished swordsman, however, events will conspire to shatter his vision of domestic bliss. Called upon by the reigning warlord to avenge a blood feud, Seibei Iguchi will find himself once again forced to draw his sword in anger. (Yes, that's the same plot as 1000 other Samurai and Cowboy flicks, but the story-telling really sets this one apart).That said, though the story is 1st rate, the poor video transfer of the U.S. DVD release mars the experience. It is not even a 16:9 Anamorphic transfer, but merely a 4:3 letterbox screening. Show this film on a screen bigger than 13" and you'll weep. For this reason I can only give it 3 stars.

Title: 4 Good remixes out of 13?
Text: A good/great remix album first of all needs songs with strong melodies -- you have to have a "hard" foundation before you mess with the structure.One of the best remix albums was the B-52's "Party Mix." Six songs, 3 on each side of the LP, and there was a continuous beat so the songs segued into each other. Pick it up and hear how it's done!Now, the Newsboys are an exceptional group and they have a GREAT foundation of music. So, how come only four (4) songs end up working?The four remixes that work are:1. Joy (Let's Be Frank Mix)2. Thrive (Is That James Dancing? Mix)3. Fad Of The Land (Lounge Mix)4. Love Liberty Disco (All Mixed Up Mix)You can still "hear" the original song but it's all mixed up with great beats. The rest are dull or just don't keep any of the foundation of the song intact.

Title: Disappointing to say the least
Text: Well, this is not the outright disaster that many critics would have you believe it is, but that doen't mean its very good either. The ABWH songs are much better than Rabin's stuff (except for the really catchy "Miracle of Life"). However, they seem to be pursuing a completely different (and less interesting) direction than on the previous ABWH album.If the band(s) had taken the half of the songs on here that are pretty good, worked them into proper Yes epic lengths and dropped the rest, this would be a pretty good album. As it is, this cd runs way too long with way too much dross. It's shocking to me that between the two "bands" at work here they couldn't come up with more good songs.

Title: This book was similiar to watching it rain.
Text: I wanted so much to love this book. It starts out beautifully describing a people, a lifestyle and a part of the country that all deserve the intricate detail that Mrs. Goodman uses to paint their picture. The problem is that after the picture is painted, it just stops. No story, no emotion, nothing. You so want the characters to interact and they simply brush against each other on occassion: even husband and wife, brother and brother. Several of the characters introduced actually dropped out of the story without an explination. I hoped until the last page that this book would "wake up." It was sort of like watching it rain. The author has mastered description, her next work should add a little story to the words.

Text: As in previous recordings, we get technical flawlessness here...great tone and diction...but McDonald continues to lack in engaging phrasing. With all her talent, she definitely "plays" better live. The sterility of the recording studio does not suit her...how's about a live concert album??? On the stage she's all fire and music, but only flickers here.What we want: storytelling a la Barbara Cook. What we get: the student from Master Class.The program is interesting and a fun departure from McDonald's more cerebral previous recordings, but as in those, I couldn't help wishing while I was listening to this record that I was instead sitting at Joe's Pub hearing her perform.If you're an Audra fan you'll like this, if you're new to her this won't convince...catch her in performance first. It'll be interesting to see how her recording style evolves.

Title: Quality issue with this one...
Text: Before buying this wallet, I had a two-tone red and black Taxi Wallet that I used for many years without any trouble. The stitching around the coin pocket eventually started to come apart and I decided it would be easier to order a new wallet rather than trying to find a way to repair my old one. I was excited to have a "pretty" Taxi Wallet this time around but, upon receiving it, was unimpressed with the quality of the leather. It seemed much thinner than my old wallet. But I transferred all my stuff to the new model and tossed it in my purse. After just a few months of use, the snap that holds the coin flap down broke off, rendering the pocket useless. Unfortunately, it was too late to return the item but it was definitely too *soon* for this item to fall apart. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this wallet...

Those critical to the premise that Marilyn had affairs with both Robert and John Kennedy will find it hard to deny the affairs in the face of the plentiful interviews and evidence in this movie.

The sisters take up about 20 pages just explaining who's who in their family, which was just about the most unbelievably dull experience I've ever had reading. Also, they always manage to sound like they were and are perfect people. It's a great premise for a book, but the story is lost when Bessie and Sadie only speak of what great things they did, and not of what the blacks of that time period did. I love Black History, but this book was an extreme disappointment to me. I'd rather read a school textbook than this book.

Text: Okay, so I admit the reason I rate this a four star album is for one cut...Trouble. For me that one song is worth the price of the CD. I could play it over and over and never tire of it. Granted it has special memories for me (it came out when I was in college), but there is something about the song...Lindsey's voice, the beat, the instrumentation, all of it combines to create one of those songs that I haven't forgotten in all of these years. Everyone has a few of "those kind of songs" hanging around; if it grabs you, that's it; you're hooked, and I'm hooked on Trouble. The rest of the album has a few cool songs and some not so cool. But it was a brave effort on Lindsey's part and I salute him for it. And like I say, Trouble is worth the price.

The connectors on this Belkin are bulky and long and do not fit as well in the HDMI port as the Monster cable. The smaller connectors on the Monster are easier to connect. You can see at a glance the superior quality of the Monster construction when you compare the two side by side. Better construction ultimately means better picture and sound quality. Yes, this cable works for HDMI and one can get by with it fine. However,the picture, sound, and quality of the Monster are much better. You definitely get what you pay for.

Title: Works adequately
Text: It seems like you have to experiment a bit to find the best way to orient the wand for maximum response (maybe it even varies by the brand of breaker box and breakers). For me it seemed to work best when the tip of the wand was parallel with the outer edge of the breaker. When you do find the "right" breaker you'll get both the tone (not to be confused with the ever-present 60Hz buzz) and the top red light is illuminated. Sometimes it seems like I get a "tie" -- pick one, open it, if the tone doesn't stop, it's the other one. Even under the worst of conditions where you can't decide, it's still somewhat handy, since flipping breakers one a time until the tone stops still beats flipping a breaker and jogging to some other part of the house to see if you got the right one.

Title: Interesting premise couldn't overcome irritating narrator
Text: I was surprised by this memoir/homage which I thought would be much more heavily food focused than it was. Obviously food (or its preparation) was the common tie between Julie and Julia, but the book is much more about Julia's quest to find herself through the admittedly odd project to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook. The book is well-written though I often found myself frustrated with the author who seemed very immature in parts.All in all a decent read for someone who was never exposed to the blog that sparked the novel. I wish I had found the author more sympathetic but as it was, my irritation with her colored my enjoyment of the book. 3 stars.

Title: Total Rip-off
Text: The book is good, but $130 dollars!!!! You still need to buy a 3 ring binder to put the sheets in, it's not even a paperback, meaning the publisher didn't even spend the money for binding. Who owns this company, Shell? Exxon? Enron?!? There are other accounting books for a fraction of the cost, but the organized crime (my community college) requires this particular one. I wonder what their incentive might be???

Title: Does what it says it does :)
Text: This product came in perfect condition, and in a timely manner which i loved! However it is very confusing trying to strap it onto the console...I basically gave up trying to strap it in and it seems to be squished between the two seats well enough that it doesnt move too much. Otherwise it does what it says it does and my dog seems to like it (after she finally figures out that she is connected to it and stops trying to jump around the car with it strapped to her collar...)

Title: not long lasting! $300 in repairs later ...
Text: We bought this mixer 6 years ago, but only used it about once a month until about a year ago. I started making my own bread about 1x a week. It is a wheat bread 3c white / 3c wheat flour. After a few months, the engine burnt out. I've had to change to 4c white & 2 c wheat because the mixer couldn't handle it. Since then, I've had to take it in two more times & have boon told by the repair tech. to either get a new mixer (he doesn't ever recommend this mixer!) the 5qt one, or quit making bread. So disappointed!! I've spent over $300 in repairs on a "professional" mixer that can not even be used on a weekly basis.

Title: Excellent book for the Lewis admirer
Text: The Lewis admirer will greatly appreciate this book and its depiction of the early life of this Christian genius. He describes his slow transformation from stanch athiest to devout Christian in the complicated simplicity that only Lewis can achieve. However, be weary of this book if you have never previously read Lewis. The development of the story is rather slow and lethargic and the non-Lewis fan may find it difficult to get through the early chapters. Yet, for the Lewis admirer the lax early chapters are well worth the culminating transformation in the late portion.

Title: Some are defective. So is the customer support.
Text: Buying a 7004AWBR is a crapshoot. I just wish I had known the odds six months ago. My 7004AWBR saga has recently ended (I hope) with the promise of a full refund (not including the cost of my wasted time) from someone who is high enough in the SMC support hierarchy to admit that certain lots of the 7004AWBR are known to be defective.The problem isn't simply that some of these don't work, it's that getting a replacment or refund took me hours and hours of time on the phone nearly threatening people to get any kind of resolution. I'm left wondering why a company which knows it has a malfunctioning product risks losing customers who are likely to go around spreading the news of their terrible experience to hardware-buying friends, familily, coworkers, and in public forums?If you buy one of these, I sincerely wish you a better experience than I have had. I will never buy from SMC again.

This book is for everyone because it has adventure, romance, and comedy all in the same interesting and wild story. David Eddings has a way of keeping your attention even during parts that are supposed to be boring. This is still my favorite book, and I still enjoy reading it now. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a spicy story and just wants to escape from the normal predictability of daily life. Enjoy!!

Title: Finally, a book without empty buzzwords and cliches
Text: So many business books these days are full of buzzwords and slogans -- stuff that just doesn't lead to any deep insight or positive change. "22 Keys" is different. It shows respect for its readers. It gets into the underlying issues and challenges that affect employee satisfaction. And it's written in a neat style -- down to earth, personable, genuine. The author seems to have done his homework too -- he knows what's happening in the real work world. In terms of a criticism (actually, more of a suggestion), it would nice to have an audiotape version of this book, because people spend so much time in their cars going to and from work.

Title: THE MUTINY ON BOARD H.M.S. BOUNTY by William Bligh
Text: This is William Bligh's personal account of the mutiny on board the H.M.S. Bounty in 1789. The first half of the account concerns the Bounty's travels among the islands, interactions with the indigenous peoples, and the transportation of breadfruit plants. These portions are quite often boring, as they get bogged down in mundane detail and nautical jargon. The account of the mutiny itself is extremely short. But the second half of the novel, Bligh's 3600 mile journey in an open boat, is gripping and astounding.Bligh's account, while more or less fair, is nevertheless one-sided. And dispute over what kind of man he was persist. If you are looking for a complete and accurate account of the mutiny in one volume, this is not it, although it is a valuable part of any such research.TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT

Be wary if you have ME and forget it with windows 2000. Who knows about XP. With ME, the keyboard arrows don't work correctly and youngsters can't advance in the math portion from atleast the 3rd level. Technical support indicated that there will be no fix for any problems experienced for systems with Windows ME, 2000, XP. A suggestion was made to purchase a gamepad controller to see if that helped.

Text: I had also bought this label maker with great promise as it has a number of features the more basic model I had did not. However, I quickly found it jammed when printing, and thus you had to reprint, eating up the tape quicker, which is not cheap. Also, I recall it requires a lot of batteries, which seem to be exhausted quickly, compared to other things I have that use far fewer batteries, like digital cameras. So, it became an expensive item to maintain (printing tape and batteries), which i got tired of doing. So I soon replaced it with a Brother, which has neither problem.

Text: If you are like me, a father just trying to make his child happy, DO NOT BUY THIS!First, there are no Childrens titles for the 360. Maybe in a few years there will be some.Second, this console IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE with most games. Check the Microsoft site and they will confirm this (about 15 levels deep into the X-Box site). However, no where in the XBox manual do they tell you this.Third, Toys R Us will sell you Xbox games(not 360) and claim they will work with the new X-Box. They simply do not! In the rare case they do work, you must first download and install a software patch! DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE!!Finally, the XBox 360 is a decent DVD player and has great graphics for those with HDTV and the hookups (MS supplies the component cables).I was a huge fan of Microsoft until this product. Don't waste your money. Also, don't waste your child's time.

Title: FORD ONLY!
Text: While the description states it works for 1994 and newer Chrysler/Jeep vehicles...it does not. I tried it on my 98 Grand Cherokee, a friends 2007 Sebring, and a 2008 300. The coupling tool didn't work for any of them. While I did not try it on any 1981+ Fords, I'd have to assume it'd work for them since that's the only other vehicle listed.Aside from them not working for my application, overall the product quality is not the best. Remember, it's plastic. Anyone who has done work with spring couplings will know that these won't last. If you're getting them for a one time fix (why I got these), they're good enough and cheap. Anything more than that, go with a better quality tool.

Title: It works
Text: Been using this for over a month now. It does create a 'white noise' sound. You can vary the pitch from a high and loud noise, to a lower pitch. It does not create the low sound of a large standing fan on low speed, so if your ears are sensitive to high pitched noises this may not be for you. I noticed at the higher level I wake with a ringing in the ear, but I have had that disorder for sometime now and this is why a small fan didn't work well for me. There are two speeds on the machine. With the unit I received I have to run it on high speed for a while before I switch it to low speed. For some reason it does not start out well on low speed. The unit does get slightly warm from running, but nothing to worry about.

Title: Reading this book was a "labor" itself.
Text: When I picked up this book, the plot seemed interesting. Quite similar to Lindsey Lohan's ABCfamily film "Labor Pains". If you have a choice between the two, choose the movie. Her acting is kinda bad, but its much more entertaining to see Lohan preggo, than reading this book.I could barely get through a sitting of the book. After 10 minutes I'd get bored. I found myself skipping paragraphs of mindless details, trying to find parts that actually pertain to the plot. I mean, I don't really care if the heroine's co-worker is obsessed with making copies at the copy machine, 2 paragraphs about it was ridiculous.Usually I love date scenes in a book, but found Jane and Tolkien's romance very very dry.I got really irritated with Jane herself, too many paragraphs about how skinny and in shape her body is. She seemed very dumb too, making up all these facts about pregnancy, and acting like a know-it-all.I don't recommend wasting your time on this book.

Title: ehh its ok
Text: Everything that made "Return of the Rentals" good is not in "7 more minutes". I was very dissapointed with this cd. I got "Renturn of the Rentals" last summer and that was my summer album, I listened to that cd for months and I didn't get tired of it. When I got "7 more minutes" I listened to it for a week and then I put it up. There are only a few songs that I like on this cd. Keep Sleeping is my favorite, but if I do listen to the cd I have to skip a lot of songs that I just can't stand. But all in all this album is ok, but no where near as good as "Renturn of the Rentals".

Title: Not a historical novel
Text: I like history a lot; I even read history books for fun sometimes. I don't know what it was about this book, but I found it very dry, and it could not capture my attention. It is exceedingly easy to put down. I learned a few interesting facts, but had very little fun along the way. I wish the author could have conveyed better what it FELT like to live in the year 1000, maybe along the lines of James Michener....I think it would be easier to enjoy and retain the information presented. The book did leave me feeling grateful to be here at the year 2000, instead of at the title year. I say to Mr. Lacey, spice it up!

I am a single working mother so wherever I go my daughter goes, so this bag WAS used alot. After about two months the inside liner tore apart. Because the inside compartments are attached to the liner, all these fell apart also. This made the diaper bag useless. Save your money and purchase a better made bag.

Title: Love it
Text: Our 5 year old loves this pogo stick. She can't do it by herself yet but she's having a blast trying. If your child gets frustrated easy, it might not be the best since it takes a lot of practice. Otherwise, it is one of those timeless toys that you might recall using as a child yourself. It's very sturdy and has taken a while to break in but overall it was a great buy. Looked great next to the Christmas tree, too, with just a bow. Obviously, it's a better toy for the spring and summer--maybe by then she'll get the hang of it.

Title: OLIVER!
Text: It is certainly the definitive version of Dicken's classic story. Polanski's canvas of visual depth and human population is striking. The hellish orphanage looks like the hull of an unfortunate slave ship, and the City of London is a paradox of dangerous alleyways and sky kissing church steeples. If there is a weak link, it is the young actor who plays Oliver, who seems merely a director's product, although it may be Polanski's intent to use a novice in presenting the innocence of a child. The rest of the cast is remarkably indebted to their characters.

It is based on a true story of a dog named Hachiku that waited 10 years for his deceased owner to come back for him (look it up on the internet). Of course, this is the Americanized version of the true Japanese story, but it is, by all means, a fair account. Be prepared to cry your eyes out, though, because as this story proves, the true loyalty and unconditional love of a dog for its owner is very special.

Title: Great for the price
Text: This food processor works very well, almost too well for its size. It is extremely easy to clean-up, however because of its small capacity, you have to be careful not to overfill it with anything slightly liquid or it will leak out the top. I wish the lid would seal better, but this seems to be a problem with any food processor. It is also plenty powerful, but you have to be careful not to over do it. I make a lot of homemade salsa, and I had to learn quickly just to "blip" it a few times otherwise I would end up with salsa soup.Overall, you can't beat it for the price. I don't use a food processor for very many things, so having a cheap small one that works well and doesn't take up much space is perfect for me.

Text: My kids, 5,7 & 9 yrs, read The Pilgrims Progress book first and then watched this DVD. The were a little disappointed. The animation is a little dated and the acting/reading was a bit too dead pan for their taste. They seemed to just be reading their lines and not acting them out.The movie follows the book closely but my kids were a little sad that it only included Christian's journey and not Christiana's as well. I had to explain that the movie was already an hour long and that it would take that long again and some to tell the other story as well.Overall It was fine. My kids watched the whole thing but I don't think it will become a favorite. I was hoping for more but got about what I thought it would be. Perhaps I will try a live action version instead.

Text: I tried the Challah about 3 times, I highly enjoyed it (although I've never had traditional Challah, so I'm not sure if mine was what it's supposed to be), the pain de campagne was fantastic (took me back to when I lived in France) and I loved the Scottish Baps. I'd have to say I made about 6 or 7 of the loaves and found them to be good quality... the italian rosemary/raisin bread was delicious to me; however, I did notice it was a bit dry. I guess I was naive to believe there were no errors because I simply thought I had made a mistake. I do believe this book has some good basic recipes, I enjoyed the breads I made and the book served to make me more excited about bread. Good for beginners!

Text: While the content of this book is probably very good (I haven't had to read other books on this subject for a fair comparison), the delivery of said content is extremely boring and outdated. The book is basically composed of paragraphs with very little use figures, tables, exhibits, etc. It's just paragraph after paragraph. My biggest issue with this book, however, was the fact that I had to constantly skip the inline citations that were everywhere! One example: a 4 sentence paragraph with 3 citations. It was very distracting to read and it took away the focus from the material to, instead, reading last names and years. I do not recommend this book whatsoever.

But be warned that Dark Destiny is not what the first "preview" chapter makes it out to be.First, the book deals with issues that are more disturbing than informative. From child rape...to more sexual intense moments this book was gory to take for something that could entertain you.Secondly, after the 5th chapter the book goes into a depressing and repetitive tone that is just boring...the love tangle between the two characters does not seem authentic, more like forced by the author.I was really disappointed by the book, and will be more careful when choosing books in the future before reading reviews like this.People easily jump into conclusions that this is the greatest read in the world...but to be honest I put the book down too many times to allow that statement.I recommend that you BORROW or get the book from the library and preread some chapters to see where you stand...good luck.

Text: Perhaps the best shot war film. Perfect use of colors, ie its emphasis in dark and red hues. The slow shutter speed used in this film also brings incredible realism to this movie. Also pretty accurate special effects. Other than than that the movie has a marginal, at best, script and plot. The acting is so-so and the chracters are completely forgetable. But in all fairness I really don't think the point of this movie was to involve the viewer in plot per se, but rather to let the viewer experience, quite accurately, one of the most historic and gruesome day in world history.

Title: Too repetitive spacesynth
Text: I really can't understand why Michiel and Erik didn't use a little bit more imagination when they were making this album. I heard that Technological Mind was produced very quickly and unfortunately it shows. Okay, there are some great leads and chord melodies. Sound quality is better than on previous albums but all the tracks are *very* similar. Those same song structures and drum sequences keep repeating all the time and the album gets damn boring after a few tracks. Can space synth music actually get any simpler than this? Technological Mind would be one of the best Laserdance albums if it had a bit more variety. It's a little bit difficult to name favorite tracks of this album because they all are so similar but I like 'Warriors', 'Dead Star' and 'Sky Orbit'. 'Technoid' is good too although the three mixes are an overdose.

How can they rejoice when they think that 75% of this failed god foresaken is going to be tormented forever in hell. Tell me how in the HELL that strengthens their faith and makes them "happy"? Praise Satan for evil people who call themselves Christians and actually enjoy this book. May they suffer in the afterlife!!

Title: Not the same as in a salon
Text: I originally first bought this product from a salon at a much higher price of course. When the one I order arrived, it did not work as well as the salon one. Packaging was different which was noted in the description not that that should matter. It has a liquid film at the top which the salon one did not. Now I understand why salon offer products at a higher price....Quality is worth it!!

Title: John Forrestal's poetry is sincere and accessible
Text: In his introduction to his collection of love poems, SENSUAL THOUGHTS, nineteen-year-old John Forrestal admits that he has "no real training in the writing of poetry" nor much knowledge of it. He writes simply for enjoyment.Many of the 59 poems betray a youthful haste and lack of "A Doubt?" expresses sharp feeling in a spare, clean and concise form; "Unknown" has a clear, cwell-maintained sense of rhythm; "Your Name Must Be Beauty" has lovely correspondences ("slowly", "softly") especially in the first stanza.On the whole, these expressions of sentiment for a real or ideal love are sincere and accessible. The book is deftly illustrated by Derek Lee

Title: This is the Right CD if you're looking for the only recording of One (a chorus line)
Text: I bought this cd for one song, One ( a chorus line). There are some other live cds of Tony Bennett live floating out there. I believe it's with Count Basie. Tony Bennett is much better on This live performance than the Basie show. Plus, the sound recording is a little better than the Basie gig. Should you buy this cd? No. The recordings on most of his old performances are terrible. Plus Mr. Bennett does not give much banter, as Sinatra or Dean Martin. But I have to give it 3 stars since it is the only recording (and best jazz swing recording) of One (a chorus line).

Title: An entertaining story on the demise of the Britannic
Text: "Britannic" is well worth watching. The pace keeps moving swiftly, and the action is compelling. The acting is impressive, especially that of Edward Atterton. Atterton plays a German spy on the ship. His mission is to either take control of the vessel or sink it. With a skillful performance, he causes the viewer to really believe that he will accomplish his mission at all costs. But in the end, he is only doing his duty. As for the movie's other qualities, the computer graphics appear cartoonish at first, but they end up adding creative and helpful scenes to the storyline. For example, the aerial shot of the German submarine's torpedoes heading towards the Britannic is quite stunning. All in all, an entertaining story speculating on the demise of the Britannic. Enjoy.

Title: A good remake
Text: Other than the fact that it seemed like Linus and Sabrina fell in love quickly (two-three days?) I found this to be a charming remaking. The first act seemed or felt rather long-watching her in Paris while she slowly tried to forget about David. I did wonder whatever happened to her photographer boyfriend-but I guess he was just meant to be a fling. Plus, I would have liked this modernized version to give her father more of a backbone other than just letting whatever happen-happen. Plus, Sabrina was supposed to be like this innocent breath of fresh air-chick who was steadily pursuing an engaged man. I questioned her intelligence to willing line up to be one of those love him and dump chicks David ran through. If she knew him as well as she said she did, why follow his blueprint to a broken heart? Still it's a charming film-a good remake-not great-but good.

Could it be something that comes out when the moon is full? Strange twist in this one. I liked it better because Benson is gone. Lucy is still the SUPERWOMAN of all time but she is not in this one as much. As usual Pete Marino is great. I really like him better than anyone else in in the series. On page 83, (paperback) he has mustard on his shirt, his tie is to short and he has on two different color socks. Marino has be demoted by the new Ass't. Chief, a lady named Bray. This is the other plot going on in the story. Bray is after Marino and Scarpetta. Will she get either one? Have to read to find out. I lilked this plot in the book better than the "hairy man" plot. All in all it was fair. Not as good as her very early books.

Title: A Great Stretch
Text: I saw Jim Wharton at a clinic for the Avon 3-Day Breast Cancer walk in NYC. I was very tight and stiff with reoccuring pain in my ankles and knees. I already did a good stretch routine in addition to morning Yoga, but I couldn't build flexibility. After just a few weeks of using this stretch program the stiffness and pain started going away. I could also get more out of my workouts and my flexibility was up. The book is pretty easy to use. You look up the activity you do and the book matches it with the right stretches. The stretching routines are long, but there are a lot of muscles to be dealt with. The diagrams are a little confusing but can be figured out. The written discriptions are easy to work with. I think this is a great book to use as an alternative stretch program.

Title: Technical problems
Text: I bought this DVD because I was impressed with Ghislaine Thesmar's commentary in the "Etoiles" documentary on the Paris Opera Ballet but had never seen her dance. I'm still not sure I have seen her dance, because there were no close-ups and the picture was, as another reviewer noted, fuzzy. The audio problems were not simply a matter of recording but also of the musical performance itself. The orchestra, band, or whatever provided the accompaniment was not identified-- for good reason. Rather than give this DVD five stars with a caveat about drawbacks, I think it is more accurate to give it two stars with the qualification that those interested in performances with "historical value" may rate it higher.

Their relationship was coming along nicely. Then Edward's former mistress came between them. Until this time Florence had seemed like a reasonable woman, if a bit naive. When the evil mistress comes around spinning lies however Florence believes them! Why would she believe a woman she barely knows over the man who has been her lover? This is never explained well. Freddy, Edward's cousin, is a great character. I thoroughly enjoyed him.Overall, it's a decent way to spend your time if you don't need one of the main characters to be too smart.

Text: I bought this for my daughter at 9 mos. She was already pulling up and cruising on furniture. I thought this would be helpful for her to get around the other areas of the house with my help. Unfortunately, it's very unsturdy and the wheels go quickly. There isn't any resistance for beginning walkers, so they will lean on the walker and it will shoot forward. I thought using it on the carpet (rather than our wood floors) might help, but no difference.By reading the description, it sounds like a great transition toy. I think you should save the money and just use an overturned box or laundry basket. Same effect.The only upside is that she enjoys the car mode when I push her. Perhaps she will grow into this toy once she walks independently. However, I think that defeats the purpose and description of this toy. It'll sit and gather dust until she wants to ride on it.

Text: This book betrays the Sherlock Holmes people know and respect. In this tale, Holmes is reduced to a semi-deranged cocaine addict in desperate need of mental help.The amount of plot in this book is about the same as one of Doyle's short stories. A tacked-on chase sequence at the end seems out of place, but since the author is a screenwriter, it is perhaps not surprising.But the worst of all is this, revealed right at the start of the book: Professor Moriarty, Holmes' most dangerous enemy in the real stories, is reduced here to a meek, ordinary schoolteacher. What a ridiculous and depressing idea! I kept waiting for the real Moriarty to show up, but no. Meyer's Holmes has no brilliant enemy to challenge him, just a boring cocaine addiction. I am surprised the owners of the Sherlock Holmes trademark approved this book.

Text: I am throwing this toaster out today, after having owned it for slightly longer than one month. It seemed to be fine for about the first week. After that, the timer started working intermittently, so that every once in a while, but with increasing frequency, what ever was in the thing would simply burn to a crisp. More recently, it started toasting unevenly, so that half the bread or bagel would be quite dark and the other half would look like it had never been in a toaster. I went out and bought a 4 slice Cuisinart toaster, which is what I should have done to begin with. It is considerably more money, but at least it works.

Text: Read this for a book club I belong to and was very disappointed in it. The novel is not nearly as imaginative as you would believe, given the premise of the story itself. Aside from the circus setting, this is a very conventional book story-wise. Which isn't necessarily a problem, except that the author attempts to stretch the story beyond what it is, often falling way too in love with her writing and going on for long, descriptive asides that lead nowhere. Ultimately, the story is tied together by a very abrupt and rushed ending. Just very unsatisfying. Not horrible but was a disappointment since there is so much critical acclaim tied to this novel.

Title: NOT WORTH IT
Text: Korean shows have many talented actors and actresses who really know how to act. not in this series. the lead actor has this blank stair on his face with no emotion and the lead actress either smiles too much or cries too much. the story line is unreal at time and the music is forgetable. if you want a good series to watch , go for stairway to heaven, sad love story, winter sonata, love letters, phoenix and hotelier. if you want sword fighting Damo is a great series to buy.

Title: laser printing yes, ink pens no
Text: I would agree with most other posters about how tough this stuff is. It laser prints well. My only complaint is that it doesn't take ink pens well. It is very slippery to write on and medium ink pens register only a very thin line (if you can get the ball rolling at all). The ink from gel type pens never seems to dry and will smear big time, even after a several minutes. A sharpie is really your only alternative. Use this stuff for permanent finalized work.

Title: Great product for thick, curly hair!
Text: My daughter, age 2, has extremely curly hair and it can be very dry and firzzy as well. I have had such a hard time with any other "detanglers" and she cries the whole time I'm brushing her hair. I was so impressed with this product because it gets the tangles right out and it leaves her hair a lot less frizzy with more soft curls. If I wash her hair, put the detangler in and comb through, the next morning I can just rewet her hair and it seems to reactivate the product; allowing me to comb through it again. Smells great too, I don't know why someone said it smelled bad.

Title: a disappointment
Text: I saw the Hallmark movie first and loved it so I went and bought the book. I was expecting a clean wholesome story like the movie, but it was not like that. In the movie the man who she had the extra-marital relationship with is only briefly mentioned, but in the book she repeatedly spends a lot of pages talking about their past relationship and even the scene of her being promiscuous. I was greatly disappointed and I threw away the book. I do not recommend this book and due to the promiscuous scene it is not even worth the rating of 3 stars. The Hallmark version, though, is a wonderful, clean, wholesome movie.The Magic of Ordinary Days - Hallmark

Text: Out of all Dean Koontz's books (and I have read them all, I think), I had the most mixed feelings about this one. The story's great, the plot's great, and the the characters are...great, except for Ginger Weiss. She was nauseating. So nauseating, in fact, that I could only take her in small doses(which is why it took me a MONTH to read the whole book; pretty bad, huh?). Anyway, she's the only reason I didn't give this book a 10, otherwise, it's an awesome read!

Title: Spout opening mechanism broke after only 9 months
Text: After living with only two reliable Revere kettles in a lifetime, we opted for something more colorful in January 2007. Copco is pretty, but I agree with reviewer that pouring puts pressure on a wrist - problem if you have arthritis. The major problem is that with only one tea drinker in the house, the plastic mechanism in the handle that opens the spout cover broke after only nine months. Seems like a durable body with flimsier plastic in handles. Revere kettle 20 years, Copco less than one. Have email into manufacturer to ask about warranty. Never thought to save receipt on a kettle since mine always lasted for decades. Product description refers to years of use. I'll update after I hear re: warranty.

Title: prone to jam--a design flaw?
Text: Canon pixma ip6700dI have owned this printer now for more than a year. Twice it has suffered a paper jam in which the paper was inaccessible inside the printer. Although there is a local warrnaty station (in Dallas), the distance is such that a roundtrip would entail 90 minutes or more. Therefore I returned it to Canon and received a refurbished replacement, which also jammed. I have now received a second replacement (also refurbished) but have limited its use mostly to large photo prints. Most text I print on a much less expensive printer with less expensive ink. I have never used the paper tray provided with the Canon and use only good quality paper. Very good results with previous Canon printers. A design flaw here!

Title: Not worth it.
Text: The FPS genre isn't in danger of have greatness redefined by DF2. The graphics and controls are decent, meaning that you can generally distinguish targets and terrain and the movement isn't difficult to master. The fundamentals of the game are sound in that the solo missions are satisfying, the campaigns follow the same theme as the solo's, but it's the multiplayer that is the biggest let down. Unfortunately there are cheat codes that find their way into the multi-play. So, for example, if you are playing flagball and someone is using speed-cheat, forget it, the game is over. And there is almost always at least one person cheating. Artillery support in King of the Hill is equally ruinous of any fun.I definitely wish I had picked up another game. Once you get tired of the solo work, which is quick, the multiplay is so dissappointing that there is no long term value in the game. Wait for something better.

Title: Fine film I would feel safe showing children
Text: First understand that I am a lover of classic disney films such as: Peter Pan, Jungle Book, Old Yeller, Snow White, Bambi, and many others. I am probably more sceptical of recent Disney releases than most of my cohorts, so this movie had to earn 4 stars from me. It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).My version of this movie comes with two short films. One is the history of the rat, which is actually very educational and informative. The other short is moderately entertaining but nothing I feel deserves more than a passing comment.

Title: Smooth and drinkable but not outstanding
Text: I am glad it is organic, and it looks as though they have put a lot into making their packaging materials healthy and earth-friendly.The flavor is mild and the amount of caffeine is very low. This is probably because there is very little green tea in this mixture. The flavor mostly comes from the toasted brown rice. This is a nice enough flavor, but it is not really like a more traditional genmaicha which has the flavors of both the toasted rice plus the green tea.I prefer either the Yamamotoyama or the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company versions of genmaicha for commercially available sources. The best tea would come from specialty importers, but that would be quite a bit more expensive.

My frame has a small flaw along the inside beaded edge--a 1" long smooth section that should be beaded. It isn't very noticeable, but for this reason I gave the frame a rating of 4 stars rather than 5 stars.

Text: This was Laszlo's attempt to do what no one has done before him -- and, alas, he doesn't come anywhere near to pulling it off. The academic grounding that Laszlo tries here to create makes for too many contorted kinds of arguments. The author points to all the right issues, and he goes at them in ways that might, under another pen, have produced some startling breakthoughs in thought. But Laszlo is not the one to take this on. For those who still hjunger for a grand synthesis of all things -- human and cosmic - I suggest turning instead to someone like Ken Wilber, or -- if you have a few months of non-stop reading time -- to the colletced works of Alice A. Bailey.I do give him an "A" for effort, however.

Text: After returning from a trip to Peru in 2012, where I was able to visit the Osma Museum of Colonial Art in Lima and also visit Cuzco, I was interested in re-reading this wonderful book about the Cuzco School of Art. The book not only contains beautiful illustrations, but it also provides a well-written and clear account of the history behind the development of this art and the manner in which indigineous and mestizo painters achieved the syncretism of two different religious beliefs and traditions, by imbibing the European art forms with their own symbolism. Anyone interested in learning about this type of art would do well to start with this book. The author writes in a way that is easy to understand, even for non art-historians, and provides a wonderful and revealing explanation of the cultural significance of these paintings.

Text: San Francisco may seem an unlikely place for the spirit of Cuban music to thrive (what about Miami?), but this is certainly the case with the Cubop record label. While other labels (RMM, Concord) lay on the smooth production, Cubop stays true to the roots, emphasizing the clavé, horns, and percussion that are at the music's core. "Viva Cubop: Jazz and the Afro-Cuban Way" is a 13-song sampler featuring the legends and new cats that are keeping the music vibrant and alive. Artists like conguero Francisco Aguabella, one of Cuba's greats; Papo Vazquez, who fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms with his sensatational trombone playing; Bobby Matos, a leading figure in Latin Jazz; John Santos, a master of percussion; and London's Snowboy, who popularized the music in Europe. The subtitle of this CD should be "a taste of the real thing," since it is.

Title: Bogged down
Text: I have to echo the sentiments of those who found the story too bogged down in technical details. I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time until I got to the part where Tempe Brennan interpreted the information in layman's terms. I thought the character development was shallow; I people prefer fleshed-out characters, I guess, not flat ones who seem to have hardly any pasts and little depth. Finally, what I found as irritating as the excessive technical jargon was all the French. A "oui" here and there would indicate that the character was of French descent (not that I cared); I didn't want the French lesson. Reichs might be proud of her bilingualism, but it was just more text for me to pass over.

Whatever it was, it kept me from enjoying the movie. I did not really find it sweet or cute or funny in any way. It was just odd. I know that people do experience such an awful form of memory loss, but to me, that makes a good dramatic film. Not a romantic comedy. I mean, I can understand why people would wish to make light of the situation and make it romantic and whatnot, but for me, it didn't work. And the parts that were supposed to be funny, really weren't. It was all kind of desperate actually.

Text: Sure, this book is targeted to managers in production, but the insights are equally applicable to consultants, bankers, or anyone else who deals with processes in their business routine.I found this book highly entertaining. I was pulled into the problems facing the title character, and enjoyed the process of working through the answers.If you like novels which impart a great deal of wisdom, this is a perfect book. It is not dry like many of its counterparts in the business section. Regardless of how applicable you find it to your business, you will not regret the time spent in these pages.My only complaint is the ending. It seems the author was rushed by the publisher to come to a hasty conclusion. I feel like I just finished part one of a two part book. Where is the smooth ending? The book lost a star for this reason alone.

Title: Book was Better
Text: The first time I read the book it took me back the 1950 and I cried all the way through it. I went to see the movie, and like ALL Nicholas Sparks books....they run everything making it into a movie. The book is called "A Walk to Remember" for a reason. And the reason why is that Landon had to walk her home after he got in trouble because he didn't have a car and everyone walked back then. The relationship started on their walks.... I have had to disassociate myself from the wonderful books when I see the movie because I know that they are NOT going to be as good and this one really got off track like Nights in Rodante and Message in a Bottle where they added characters, and took out 1/2 the letters, and The Notebook where they changed the ending and have ruined any chances of "The Wedding" becoming a movie.

Title: Witchcraft 10 - believe it or not
Text: The story line has gone off the deep end with this installment! The "hot" detective returned from WC 9 - & joined forces with a white witch to fight against a satanist and a vampire who wanted to steal power away from a demon. If this were any further out there, it would have been a great comedy. Instead, it was just poorly acted comic relief. Since I'm working on getting the entire series, I'm hoping the next one(s) will be better. Please!!

Text: I originally asked for D. Niven's version, yet, I got a cartoon one from you guys(!) So I reordered, hoping this time I get the right thing. It's no big deal, especially considering the lower price of the item, a used one. Only thing, is, I hate having no choice over things, and accepting them because again, it's "no big deal."

Title: Very good read
Text: I very much enjoyed this book except the ending kinda left things hanging and unresolved. That seems to me was done only so there could be a sequel. I mean, the Greenwood massacre in Tulsa was in 1921 so it can hardly be coincidental that Luther and Lila are back there again at the end of the book as 1920 dawns.Lehane is very good I think in bringing out the human-ness of characters, flaws and good points, and the main characters were folks you turn the page for, to see what happens to them next. I was not as bothered by the Babe being there throughout, in many ways his struggles were a big part of what was going on in 1918-1919 Boston, and between workers and owners of the time. I'm glad he was part of this book.

Title: Merely competent Stones
Text: When I was fifteen, this was my first Stones album. The year was 1988, and the last Stones album was Undercover *Shudder*. Except for the usual cadre of 10 songs heard on classic rock stations all the time in the Rust Belt, I had no idea that the Stones could make compelling music, and this album didn't help matters much. It took me years of bumbling around to find the really good stuff on the earlier albums. As for this taken on its own terms, there ARE some good songs here, peppered with filler. I particularly liked "Time Waits for No one" and "Till the Next Goodbye." Languid but good mid-tempo stuff. I also really enjoy "Fingerprint File", which at least sounded like they were trying something different. As opposed to the title track and most of the other songs on the album, which is more Stones-by-numbers than anything else.

Title: A very disappointing book for software developers
Text: Some people appear to really like this book. It has received many glowing reviews, but I can only shake my head in disagreement. This book is a dud -- too much text, and not enough practical advise or code examples.The author could not adequately describe how to use basic XML components such as Document Type Definitions (DTDs), and failed to show how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to display XML on the web.If you are a web programmer or need to do something useful withXML, look elsewhere. This is not the book for you. In fact, I'm selling this book. Wanna buy it? I'll use the proceeds to purchase "Beginning XML" by Kurt Cagle. That book looks promising.

Text: Okay, perhaps I'm a tiny bit spoiled by having played all of the Baldur's Gate titles, expansions, etc., but I found this game to be really, REALLY slow. I often found myself reading while the daimyo healed my characters. The characters would be healed, then hacked to bits within 3 minutes, back to the daimyo to begin the cycle anew. Geez! I agree with a previous critique, the sorcerer is worthless. I do however, like the little dance he does when he dies!

Text: Bought this from Petco for use with Gerbils just last weekend and am already moving to a fish tank. I had the cage on my wooden garage workbench. The ball rolled off the top of the cage onto the workbench and the clips that hold the ball together broke. The depth of the bottom pan is not nearly deep enough as half the bedding ends up on our floors. The ball clouded up from gerbil waste within hours of them moving in, requiring it to be cleaned daily, unless you like watching waste go around in circle. Ball was noisey and really seemed to be held on ever so precariously. Really not pleased with this cage.

I have been having wireless network problems and wanted something that would extend my lan in the house without lots of wiring. This is a great answer. I read the directions (made sure it was not plugged into a power strip), plugged in near my router, went upstairs, plugged it in there and it worked, no problems and as fast as when right next to the router.I must admit there was also a somewhat unresearched idea that my data is safer on a wire network than wireless, even with the encryption that I used when my wireless worked.

Title: Almost forty years I waited for this....
Text: As a huge Rolling Stones fan in the early 60's Hungary, in 1965 heard first two Pretty Things albums (The Pretty Things, Get the Picture?). I was amazed at their energy, looks and unique sound. They quickly became my favorite as much as the Stones. I lost track of them in recent years and this CD brough back all their originality without loosing their youthful great music. Thank you Phil, Dick and the other Pretty's and thank you for the song "Vivian Prince" for bringing back memories of the wildest drummer in his time. This is my favorite piece on the album together with "Play With Fire" and "God Give Me The Strength". This is the greatest Pretty Things album since the 60's!!!Andras Pallavicini, Toronto, Ontario

And since you cannot connect with them, you don't care about how their lives are going.The acting is pretty solid, it's not their fault, I'm sure it's just the material.

Text: By the middle of this book I found myself siding with Ms. Rosen's fundamentalist monsters. Why? Certainly not out of any respect for their fear-driven madness, but out of revulsion for the unrelenting snide tone of the author. Sure the stories border on the grotesque, but so does Ms. Rosen's smug self-righteousness. I'd say she has more in common with the Keswick staff than she realizes.

Title: Good Gran Sabana Coverage, but it falls apart!
Text: The most unfortunte thing about this book is that it is poorly constructed and falls apart easily under even light "travel" strain. On the other hand, despite horrific maps, it is a fairly good guide. Thorough coverages is provided for both the Gran Sabana and Amazonas regions, including helpful narratives of people who have undertaken various explorations. It is especially useful if you plan to drive, as it occasionally mentions hotels with garages and gives detailed information on certain routes.Buy Bradt for the guide, but Lonely Planet Venezuela for the maps.

Not to mention the fact that "Eulogy" is 8 minutes 28 seconds, that makes it a pretty long song in my book.

Also, his frequent references to his living in Colorado, as if that helps his thesis. Go Broncos! He literally makes up a fantasy man who he fits into the Shakespeare suit like a mannikin. He seems to think he was Jewish, a foreigner, yet was so intimate with the Virgin Queen that they made a lifetime vow together. I think not. Shakespeare was Edward de Vere.

Title: It's just so bad!
Text: This game is a classic case where the game developer released something to merely cash in on the popularity of the Puffy/Ami/Yumi franchise. The game is entirely a side-scrolling fighter (except for the occasional forgetful mini-games)and you'll fight 3 or 4 of the same enemies over and over again on a level, then it's off to the next level to fight the next 3 or 4 new enemies over and over AND OVER. I was prayiing that each level would end before it ever began. This is just too bad because the sound samples and amount of unlockable content made me want to keep playing; sadly the repetitive gameplay overshadows anything positive the game can offer. Don't buy this for yourself and don't you dare buy it for your children -no matter how much they beg you, because if you do, they will grow up hating you for it!

The case feels very nice and it fits very well and the grip on the two sides makes the note much easier to hold compared to it w/o since it is so slippery. However, there are issues w/ the case.

Title: Very dubious reprint.
Text: Used copies of the original of this are readily available and *significantly* cheaper than this so-called affordable edition. To make matters worse, Ward Press seems not to have any web presence whatsoever, leading me to be rather suspicious, especially since, to my knowledge, all editions of this particular text are still under copyright, which is why they are not available through Google Books or any other scanning system.It's worth noting that nowhere in the description is the date of original publication mentioned for this, which is concerning, as it is important to know which edition of the repeatedly-revised original this actually is.I would love to be wrong in my suspicions, but I very much fear that I'm not.

Title: Insightful
Text: "An Unquiet Mind" was recommended to me by a family member to give me some insight into the mind of someone struggling with bipolar disorder. It is not a clinical analysis, but instead the story of someone with the illness and the effect, both positive and negative, that it had on her life. Jamison's clinical background gives weight to her observations of her own behavior, often giving both sides (formal and informal) to the thoughts swirling in her mind. Colloquial in style, I highly recommend this especially to those struggling with bipolar disorder or to family members of those with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder.

Title: Disappointing
Text: The story starts off promising as Nora Roberts sets the stage for her mystery. However, about halfway through the book the story gets bogged down and becomes predictable. The characters become cookie-cutter, and the story sort of veers off on a couple of tangents.The character of Dwight pops up at seemingly inopportune times in the story, and because Nora draws attention to him by doing that, it kind of gave the story away, in my opinion.I stopped reading the book for a few weeks because I was bored with it, and when I picked it up a few weeks later, the story unfolded just as I suspected.I love Nora's books, but I wouldn't recommend this one.

Title: This is mean parenting
Text: This book is terrible, what it advocates are CIO and timed feedings both of which are not beneficial to a child. If you want a parenting book I suggest the DR. William Sears baby book. It will explain with documented cited sourced facts and information as to why "baby wise" parenting is wrong and harmful to your child. NO babies are the same and there is no "way" or "schedule" that a child is set to follow. Babies espeacily those that are breast feed want to suckle not only for substance but for comfort a feeling of closeness that they shared with you in the womb, why deny them of that? CIO that's a good way for your child to mistrust you. Crying is the way children communicate and for a parent not to respond to a childs cries demeans the child. How can a parent listen to thier little one cry, your little one simply wants to be with you, again why deny them of that. Please,Please read up on other methods for the benefit of your child.

Admittedly, Hume's Treatise is pretty dense (I've never been able to get more than 100 pages into it), but his two Enquires are masterpieces of philosophical literature. Anthony Flew's edition of the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding has helpful notes and interesting biographical materials (such as Adam Smith's touching memorial of Hume). Great stuff.

Text: The Black and Decker Airstation has been useless to me. My first time using it, after less than a minute of pumping, the unit refused to work. It would simply not run. Come to find out that it had blown an internal fuse. This fuse is not even socketed, so it is a pain to replace. After replacing, the next time I used it, it again blew a fuse. This was not a high pressure or strenuous inflation job. I never went above 40 PSI (unit says it can do 160), and never more than 60 seconds of running time. Totally worthless - buy something else.

Title: Not great . . . but good
Text: I read this book to my seven year old son after reading the original Peter Ban by James Barrie. My son enjoyed most of the book . . . I found myself skipping over several of the Peter Pan and Tiger Lily encounters as I thought this inappropriate for a children's story and even took away from the innocence of childhood. My son enjoyed the "answers" to some of his questions from the original story and usually begged me to continue reading as we read one to two chapters each evening. I, on the other hand, thought it was "just okay" -- not as magical as it could've been. I would've liked to hear more details about the fairies and more of the "fun" of childhood and of playing games, etc. I would, however, recommend it to other parents of children who liked the original Peter Pan book or movie and who want some answers.

Forget about extras at this price. 20th Century collection is for a collector of about every kind of music without being a big fan. With this serie of DVDs, you can get a few cheap priced DVDs with a short, but good content.Unfortunatly, videos on this DVD are not the best. A lot of content is missing. If you want a bit more, buy the official "Tears Roll Down" greatest hits videos. You will get twice as many videos. Sound quality is the same on both DVDs, same recording as on the CD.I gave *** because of the good value. The content is very short.

Title: Disturbing, Flawed Gore Pic
Text: While this film is by no means great (or terrible), it certainly remains one of the most disturbing from the gore wave of the '80s. The leading lady deserves a lot of credit for creating an iconic character. She is attractive, revolting, monstrous and pitiful all at once. Overall, the film is pretty sickening, rising above the level of utter hack schlock, but lacking the nuance to make it work. Bride of Reanimator is ultimately the more disgusting femme outing, but this one came closer to doing something worthwhile.

Text: I used this ONE time to remove oil from my van. When I went to use it just 3 days later on my other car, it would not extract transmission fluid.The plastic fitting that connects to the top of the unit was sucking air, so it would not create a vacuum. I had to stuff a circular piece of paper napkin between the fitting and the opening to get it to seal and work somewhat.After the first use the unit was rinsed with a mild solvent and cleaned as per the instructions. The oil I extracted from the van was NOT synthetic (see someone else's review on that subject). I now need to find the correct size O-ring to replace the defective,leaky original.The fitting should be of the threaded type and not a press fit that becomes leaky in a short time!

Right after finishing "Three Cups of Tea," I read "Three Cups of Deceit" by my favorite author Jon Krakauer.

I spent an hour trying to figure why my code wasn't working, untill I compiled the code in the book and discovered it didn't either.As for the appendix, I'm pretty shocked at the waste of paper, as one sentence per method would have made it so good. It's much worse than the "in a nutshell" books, which give a description of the main methods in the opening paragraph. Could have been so much better. Even at this price you're paying way too much.I'm going to be very cautious before I ever buy a "Pure xxx" book again.

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 382.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 44.40 GiB of which 232.88 MiB is free. Process 1605762 has 19.88 GiB memory in use. Process 1612264 has 4.72 GiB memory in use. Process 1612549 has 2.76 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 16.77 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.93 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 145.87 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
